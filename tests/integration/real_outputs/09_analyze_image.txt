Parameters:
- image_path: tests/3.0b/real_outputs/test_image.png
- prompt: "Describe what you see in this image"

Result: SUCCESS

Output:
The image displays a simple, minimalist graphic.

At its center is a solid, perfectly circular shape. This circle is colored a uniform 
medium blue, resembling a cyan or robin's egg blue. It has no discernible texture, 
gradients, or shadows, appearing as a flat, two-dimensional element.

The blue circle is set against a plain, solid white background.

The circle is centrally positioned within the square frame of the image, with ample 
white space surrounding it on all sides, creating a clean and uncluttered aesthetic.
